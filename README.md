# Blockchain-Water-Rights
We have implemented a blockchain based solution to address water scarcity problem.
In that there will be a water distributor that will be selling water through blockchain. In
current situation, water is being distributed by government bodies or private
organizations. The buyer does not have the enough information about the water quality
and authenticity of the distributor. Using the blockchain solution, buyers can view all
the information pertaining to the water quality offered by the distributor and whether
the distributor is authorized to sell the water. Our blockchain based solution prevents
misinformation or tampering of records about water quality and approvers.
Our smart contract has three user groups: voters, buyers and seller.
Seller is the owner of the smart contract and is responsible for registering voters. Smart
contract function used for registering voters is register Once voters are registered by
seller, each voter can approve or reject the water license by casting vote. Each voter
has a weight assigned, once the total number of votes approved equals 3, the license
will get automatically approved and buyers can start purchasing water.

Using blockchain and nft to implement a solution to solve water crisis problems in areas having low level of ground water. Two of 
features of the solutions would be having an nft that could validate the water quality being traded from seller to buyer. And, a 
contract to establish agreement rights to sell the water to buyers.
