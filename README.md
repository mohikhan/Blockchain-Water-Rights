# Blockchain-Water-Rights

Using blockchain and nft to implement a solution to solve water crisis problems in areas having low level of ground water. Two of 
features of the solutions would be having an nft that could validate the water quality being traded from seller to buyer. And, a 
contract to establish agreement rights to sell the water to buyers.
